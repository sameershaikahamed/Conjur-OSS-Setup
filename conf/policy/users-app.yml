#There are different ways to accomplish this, but one possibility is to update the users-app.yml file to include a Host Factory:
#REf link https://developer.cyberark.com/blog/understanding-conjur-policy/
- !policy
  id: users-app
  body:
    - &variables
      - !variable db-username
      - !variable db-password

    - !group secrets-users

     - !layer apps-layer

    - !host-factory
      id: apps
      layers: [ !layer apps-layer ]

      

    # secrets-users can read and execute
    - !permit
      resource: *variables
      privileges: [ read, execute ]
      role: !group secrets-users


    - !grant
      role: !group secrets-users
      member: !layer apps-layer
